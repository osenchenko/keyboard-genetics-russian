## Usage

1. Clone this repository

2. Create the `text` folder and fill it in with `*.txt` files which you'd like
   to use as the test data source. I used a series of articles from various
   online media. I don't have copyrights to provide them with this project, so
   you will have to use your own source.

3. Run `npm start` to boot the AI design process. Exact constrains can be set
   in the `src/genome.js` file.

4. Run `npm test` to run the final comparisons against existing layouts
